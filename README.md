# Real-time transcription from microphone

Transcribing in real-time is a super skill only court reporters can brag about. But luckily, we don’t need to learn how to type fast to get transcriptions of audio quickly. Thanks to Assembly AI’s real-time speech recognition end point, it is very simple to set up a python script that can listen for audio and turn it to text.

In this video, we will see how to create this script on Python with the help of pyaudio, web sockets and asynchronous functions. The app will have the power to listen to audio input through a microphone and display the transcription in real-time. We will integrate this code into a simple Streamlit application to showcase the real-time speech recognition with a touch of interactivity.
